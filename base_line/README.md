Base Line
=================

I need an start point for my porject and for this reason I develop this base line project.

Is required to install nodejs for its use. Afte cloning is necesary to run the command "npm install" in order to install all the dependencies.

This base line has 2 main comands "grunt server" to run a preview in a server for rapid development and "grunt android" to run in android emulator.
